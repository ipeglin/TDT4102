I still struggle with the same problems as ten years ago.
I succeed in small matters but the real goal remains unattainable, even though it sometimes seems palpably close.
It is hard, yet rewarding: hard because the goal is beyond my abilities,
 but rewarding because it makes one oblivious to the distractions of everyday life.
